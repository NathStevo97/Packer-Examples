# Packer-Win2019-HyperV
Repository containing code to create a Windows Server 2019 image using the hyperv-iso Packer builder.

#Disclaimer
This is a modified version of the files included in https://github.com/marcinbojko/hv-packer by Marcin Bojko, all credit goes to him for these files.

I upgraded the files to HCL2 Format in line with Current best Practices, I have not made any changes to the scripts provided in the original repo (they can be cut as desired).
