# Packer-Windows-2019-Example

A series of HCL files to create Windows 2019 VM images via Packer as a PoC

Note: 

These scripts were not created by me originally, I merely used packer's HCL2_Upgrade on the JSON files here https://github.com/eaksel/packer-Win2019 and made a couple of minor tweaks as I want to use these for learning purposes, so thank you eaksel for creating the initial configuration files.
